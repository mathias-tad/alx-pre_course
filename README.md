* First I create a directory called alx-pre_course in the home dorectory and I create a README.md file which have this content
* I add the README.md to a git with "git add README.md" command
* I commit it with a message of 'My first commit' using "git commit -m "My first commit" command
* I add the remote origin with "git remote add origin https://github.com/mathias-tad/alx_pre_course.git" command
* Finally I pushed the README.md file to the github using "git push -u origin main" command

This is an update for my README.md file from a github.com website
